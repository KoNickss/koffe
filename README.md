# koffe
# This repo has been moved to https://aur.archlinux.org/koffe after it's release on the aur, clone that if you want to review the
package.
# If you're using another distrbution/MacOS create a chroot system (using the bootstrap image on the arch page), configure the repos, then simply install koffe from the aur either manually or with an aur helper. If you're on windows see if you can find arch in WSL or switch to a better OS.
koffe is a great tool for making intuitive, offline archlinux installers. Since some steps for mastering an arch iso require arch-linux, everything runs inside a container you have to create yourself. Every package installed to the new computer via the installer are from the repo, including base and linux, so no copy-pasting from the iso that could cause issues later.
